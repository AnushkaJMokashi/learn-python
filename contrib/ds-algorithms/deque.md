## Double-Ended Queue (Deque)

A double-ended queue (deque) supports insertion and deletion from both ends, making it a more versatile queue implementation.

### Input-Restricted Deque

In an input-restricted deque, elements can only be inserted from one end while deletions can occur from both ends.

### Output-Restricted Deque

An output-restricted deque allows elements to be deleted from one end only, while insertions can be made from both ends.

## Real Life Examples of Deques

### Task Scheduling

Deques are useful in task scheduling algorithms where tasks can be added to either end and processed accordingly based on priority or other scheduling criteria.

### Sliding Window Problems

Algorithms solving sliding window problems often use deques to efficiently manage and query elements in the current window.

### Implementations in Python

Python provides a built-in `collections.deque` which supports efficient append and pop operations from both ends. It's ideal for scenarios requiring a simple and efficient double-ended queue.

## Operations on a Deque

- **isEmpty**: Checks if the deque is empty.
- **appendLeft**: Adds an element to the left end of the deque.
- **appendRight**: Adds an element to the right end of the deque.
- **popLeft**: Removes and returns the element from the left end of the deque.
- **popRight**: Removes and returns the element from the right end of the deque.
- **peekLeft**: Returns the element from the left end without removing it.
- **peekRight**: Returns the element from the right end without removing it.
- **clear**: Removes all elements from the deque.

## Implementation of Deque in Python

Python's `collections.deque` provides an efficient implementation of a deque.

```python
from collections import deque

# Creating a deque
dq = deque()

# Adding elements to the deque
dq.append(1)
dq.append(2)
dq.append(3)

# Removing elements from the deque
dq.popleft()  # Removes and returns 1
dq.pop()      # Removes and returns 3

# Peeking elements
print("Left end peek:", dq[0])
print("Right end peek:", dq[-1])

# Displaying elements in the deque
print("Deque:", list(dq))
```

## Example: Sliding Window Maximum

In this example, we'll use a deque to efficiently find the maximum element in sliding windows of a list.

```python
from collections import deque

def sliding_window_maximum(nums, k):
    if not nums:
        return []

    n = len(nums)
    result = []
    dq = deque()

    for i in range(n):
        # Remove elements from the deque that are out of the current window
        while dq and dq[0] <= i - k:
            dq.popleft()

        # Remove elements from the deque that are less than the current element
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] <= nums[i]:
            dq.pop()

        # Add the current element index to the deque
        dq.append(i)

        # Add the maximum of the current window to the result
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[dq[0]])

    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
k = 3
print("Sliding Window Maximum:", sliding_window_maximum(nums, k))
```

## Conclusion

Queues and deques are fundamental data structures that facilitate efficient data processing and 
management in various applications. Understanding their principles and implementations is crucial 
for developing robust software solutions.
